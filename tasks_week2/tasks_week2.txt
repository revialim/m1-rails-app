1. Pick a story that requires you to introduce at least one new Resource to your Project.

- Users can add a like to the picture they are looking at.


2. Update your sketch of the data model, if needed.

- A like is an entity/resource adds a username (of the user who likes the image) to an image.

- The liking user is stored as a string.

3. Update your view sketches to integrate the new resource.

--> see 'tasks_week2_sketches.jpg'

4. Create the new resource.

Created the like resource via "rails generate scaffold like user_name:string picture_entry:references".


5. Declare the Association in the other Model class

Added "has_many: likes" association to picture_entry class.


6. Adapt/Extend the migrations as needed.

Adapted migrations by running "rake db:migrate" after generating likes resource. The automatically generated migration was sufficient for my case.


7. Adapt Model/Views/Controllers to new model

The view of the picture entry had to be adjusted. The form for adding likes and a list of all existing likes was integrated into the picture entry view.

I added "@likes = @picture_entry.likes.all" and "@like = @picture_entry.likes.build" to the picture_entry_controller.rb, so that the like could be displayed in the picture entry view.


8. Implement some more
