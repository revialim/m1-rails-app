1. Create at least one happy-path feature test for each person on your team. Use Capybara.

Going to test following feature:
- black-and-white filter-toggle

2. Test cleanup

Was not necessary, because running 'rails test' had no failures or errors.

--------------------
See following status message:
---
$ rails test
Running via Spring preloader in process 5955
Run options: --seed 57595

# Running:

...............

Finished in 0.616398s, 24.3349 runs/s, 30.8242 assertions/s.

15 runs, 19 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 skips
--------------------

(It might be useful to keep some of the generated tests around while you haven’t implemented enough tests to be confident that they cover enough of your application - we’ll see an excellent example of this later!)
--> Due to this hint, I rather keep all the generated tests.


3. Create test data for the tests using fixtures.



4. Create a model test.


5. Create seed data for playing around in development mode, and also some if you need/want seed data in production.


6. Set up automated integration tests on travis ci for your project. Include a “build passing” button in your readme.

7. Set up an Automated Deployment to Heroku for your project.

8. For the bored: set up a build matrix testing both against postgres and sqlite on travis

9. Automatically Deploy every successful Build from Travis.
